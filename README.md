# Multi-Camera Multi-Object Tracking on the Move via Single-Stage Global Association Approach

## Introduction

This is the next version of our [DyGLIP](https://github.com/uark-cviu/DyGLIP) to solve the multi-camera multi-object tracking problem on autonomous vehicles.

## Implementation

The implementation will be available soon.
